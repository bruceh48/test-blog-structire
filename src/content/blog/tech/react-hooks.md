# Understanding React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Let's dive into the most important hooks and their use cases.

## Essential Hooks

1. useState
2. useEffect
3. useContext
4. useRef

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Click me: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Master these hooks to build better React applications!
